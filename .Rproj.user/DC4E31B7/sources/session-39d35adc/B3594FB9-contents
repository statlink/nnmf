Description: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique to factorize a matrix with nonnegative values into the product of two matrices. Covariates are also allowed. Parallel computing is an option to enhance the speed and high-dimensional and large scale (and/or sparse) data are allowed. Relevant papers include: Wang Y. X. and Zhang Y. J. (2012). Nonnegative matrix factorization: A comprehensive review. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25(6), 1336-1353 <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2012.51> and Kim H. and Park H. (2008). Nonnegative matrix factorization based on alternating nonnegativity constrained least squares and active set method. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 30(2), 713-730 <doi:10.1137/07069239X>.
