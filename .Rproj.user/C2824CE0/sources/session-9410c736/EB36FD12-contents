Description: Nonegative matrix factorization (NMF). Parallel computing is an option to enhance the speed and high-dimensional and large scale (and/or sparse) data are allowed.

IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 25(6), 1336-1353 <doi:10.1109/TKDE.2012.51> and Kim H. and Park H. (2008). Nonnegative matrix factorization based on alternating nonnegativity constrained least squares and active set method.
