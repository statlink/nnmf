Simplicial archetypal analysis minimizing the Frobenius norm
}

\description{
Simplicial archetypal analysis minimizing the Frobenius norm using quadratic programming.
}

\usage{
snmf.qp(x, k, W = NULL, H = NULL, k_means = TRUE, veo = FALSE, lr_h = 0.1,
maxiter = 1000, tol = 1e-6, ridge = 1e-8, history = FALSE, ncores = 1)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
An \eqn{n \times D} matrix with compositional data. Zero values are allowed.
}
\item{k}{
The number of lower dimensions. It must be less than the dimensionality of the data, at most \eqn{D-1}.
}
\item{W}{
If you have an initial estimate for W supply it here. Otherwise leave it NULL.
}
\item{H}{
If you have an initial estimate for H supply it here, otherwise leave it NULL.
}
\item{k_means}{
If this is TRUE, then the K-means algorithm is used to initiate the W and H matrices.
}
\item{veo}{
If the number of variables excceeds the number of observations set this is equal to TRUE.
}
\item{lr_h}{
If veo is TRUE, then the exponentiated gradient method is used to update the H matrix. In this case you need to supply the value of the learning rate, which is 0.1 by default.
}
\item{maxiter}{
The maximum number of iterations allowed.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance value to terminate the quadratic programming algorithm.
}
\item{ridge}{
A small quantity added in the diagonal of the \eqn{D} matrix.
}
\item{history}{
If this is TRUE, the reconstruction error at each iteration is returned.
}
\item{ncores}{
Do you want the update of W to be performed in parallel? If yes, specify the number of cores to use.
}
}

\details{
Simplicial nonnegative matrix factorization using quadratic programming is performed. This is the classical NMF with simplicial constraints on the matrices \eqn{W} and \eqn{H}. The objective function to be minimized is the square of the Frobenius norm.
}

\value{
\item{W}{
The \eqn{W} matrix, an \eqn{n \times k} matrix with the mapped compositional data.
}
\item{H}{
The \eqn{H} matrix, an \eqn{k \times D} matrix. Each row of this matrix is a compositional vector.
}
\item{Z}{
The reconstructed data, \eqn{Z = WH}.
}
\item{obj}{
The reconstruction error, \eqn{ ||x - Z||_F^2}.
}
\item{error}{
If the argument history was set to TRUE the reconstruction error at each iteration will be performed, otherwise this is NULL.
}
\item{iters}{
The number of iterations performed.
}
\item{runtime}{
The runtime required by the algorithm.
}
