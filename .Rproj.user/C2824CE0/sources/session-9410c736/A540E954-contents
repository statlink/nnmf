Pyramid diagram

\description{
Pyramid diagram.

\usage{
pyramid(x, colour = "red", point_size = 4, face_alpha = 0.15)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the compositional data.
}
\item{colour}{
If you want the points to appear in different colour put a vector with the colour
numbers or colours.
}
\item{point_size}{
The size of the plotted points. Note that the points appear as boxes.
}
\item{face_alpha}{
This controls the transparency of the tetrahedron faces:
When face_alpha= 0, this is completely transparent (invisible faces). When face_alpha=1, this is completely opaque (solid faces). When face_alpha = 0.15 (the default value) it is very transparent (you can see through the faces easily).
}
}

\details{
This is the pyramid that visualizes compositional data with 4 components in the 3D space.
}

\value{
The pyramid plot.
