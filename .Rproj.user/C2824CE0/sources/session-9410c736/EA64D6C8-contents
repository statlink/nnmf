Description: Nonegative matrix factorization (NMF) with simplicial constraints using many algorithms is implemented. Parallel computing is an option to enhance the speed and high-dimensional and large scale (and/or sparse) data are allowed. These techniques are used for dimensionality reduction with simplicial (compositional) data.
